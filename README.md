# Apex By Example

This repository is a curated collection of patterns, practices, and principles for developing in Apex, the programming language used on the Salesforce platform. It serves as a practical reference for developers looking to enhance their Apex skills and deepen their understanding of the language.

The collection includes a wide range of examplesâ€”from basic syntax and data types to more advanced topics like asynchronous processing and external system integration.

Each example is organized in its own folder and includes a README file that explains the purpose and usage. Source files may include Apex classes, triggers, and test classes. Examples are grouped by functionality or topic for easy navigation.
